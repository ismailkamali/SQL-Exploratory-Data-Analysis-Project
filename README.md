This is a data analysis project, built on the dataset used in my previous data cleaning project.
I have created this project to further develop my SQL skills such as: substring manipulation, double CTEs, etc.
I followed tutorials from https://www.youtube.com/@AlexTheAnalyst for guidance and inspiration.
Although a guided project, the skills and functions used were based off previous lessons by the same YouTube channel.
While I followed the steps provided, I also applied my own modifications and comments to reinforce and deepen my understanding of SQL.
